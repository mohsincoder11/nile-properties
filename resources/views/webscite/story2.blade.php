                        Tirchy district in Tamil Nadu is interesting
                        Ravana was the king of Lanka (present
                        day Srilanka). He was a learned scholar.
                        But at one time he kidnapped Sita, the
                        wife of Rama.<br> His brother, Vibhishan told
                        him many times that this was wrong, but
                        Ravana refused to listen. Hence,<br>
                        Vibhishana in order to establish Dharma
                        he fought alongwith Rama against
                        Ravana. Rama with the help of Vibhishan,
                        Sugreeva, Hanuman (Bajrangbali) and
                        Jambhavan the bear defeated Ravana.

                    <p align="justify">Since Vibhishana had helped him in the
                        dharmic war against Ravana, Rama made
                        him the king of Lanka. Rama returned to
                        Ayodhya and was coronated as king.
                        Coronation is like a swearing in ceremony<br>Rama gave him a statue of Vishnu as a
                        gift. Rama told him that under no
                        circumstance should he place the statue
                        on the floor.
                        Once Vibhishana got into the water, the
                        boy kept the statue on the banks of the
                        Cauvery.
