                                                    Lanka (present day Srilanka). He was a learned scholar. But
                                                    at one time he kidnapped Sita, the wife of Rama.

                                                    His brother, Vibhishan told him many times that this was
                                                    wrong, but Ravana refused to listen.

                                                    Vibhishana in order to establish Dharma he fought alongwith
                                                    Rama against Ravana. Rama with the help of Vibhishan,

                                                    Since Vibhishana had helped him in the dharmic war against
                                                    Ravana, Rama made him the king of Lanka. Rama returned to

                                                    Rama gave him a statue of Vishnu as a gift. Rama told him
