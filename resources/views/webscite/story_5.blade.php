                                                    In Kashi, there used to reside a staunch Sivabakth.
                                                    His wife was an equally pious and dutiful lady.
                                                    They were leading a peaceful and pleasant life in the
                                                    eternal city.

                                                    The man used to bathe in the Ganges everyday, do his prayers
                                                    and meditation before coming home. One day, he was so
                                                    immersed in his meditation that he lost track of time and
                                                    was standing there. He was in a state of deep meditation
                                                    or Samadhi. His wife was getting worried and was pacing
                                                    their house waiting for him.

                                                    Shiva who was seeing this from his abode in Kailash told Ma
                                                    Parvati "See my devotee is so immersed in his meditation
                                                    that he has lost track of time and is in a state of
                                                    Samadhi".
                                                    The divine mother, being practical and kind said, "You are

                                                    about him and pacing her home. What about her devotion and
                                                    love towards her husband?"

                                                    took the form of his devotee and
                                                    came to their home. The

                                                    and placed the leaf to serve the food.

                                                    When Shiva was about to start eating, the original husband
                                                    came back and knocked on the door.
                                                    The lady of the house opened the door and got confused
                                                    seeing this.
                                                    She recovered immediately, took
                                                    your a few drops of water and said "Whoever is not my
                                                    husband, will become a begging ascetic." Saying thus she sprinkled
                                                    the water on both
                                                    the men. Immediately Shiva turned into a begging ascetic
                                                    with a bowl.

                                                    In the meanwhile, Parvati came to say what happened to her

                                                    in his devotee's home. She saw Shiva had become a begging

                                                    the streets of Kashi with a begging bowl.
