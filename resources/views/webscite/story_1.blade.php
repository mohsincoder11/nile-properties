                                                    One day, Kutty Pullaiyaar after a sumptuous meal of
                                                    kozhkkatais, appams, sundal, payasam and his favourite

                                                    java plum ) was strolling slowly with his big belly jiggling
                                                    under his serpent belt as he had eaten such a hearty meal
                                                </p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 19px; color: black;">
                                                    It was a pournima night and the
                                                    moon was
                                                    luminescent with cool rays and radiated golden light.
                                                    Chandran, looking
                                                    down at little Ganesh staggering along, found it very funny.
                                                    He burst
                                                    into a fit of giggles which suddenly interrupted that quiet
                                                    night with
                                                    the bright moon.
                                                </p>

                                                    Pullaiyaar was puzzled as he was
                                                    enjoying
                                                    his quiet post meal walk when he heard it . He looked up and
                                                    saw the
                                                    moon laughing away with tears streaming down his eyes.
                                                    Pullaiyaar
                                                    innocently chuckled as he thought it was a joke and asked
                                                    Chandran to
                                                    share it with him </p>

                                                    class="spectral">Chandran laughed harder and said, “
                                                    Ooohhh!! I saw you swaying from side to side your slow gait
                                                    and your big belly jiggling and that is exactly what I found
                                                    funny!” “Just look at me! I am beautiful, bright, golden and
                                                    so perfect.” As we all know, Pullaiyaar is extremely
                                                    intelligent. His buddhi is razor sharp. Even though he was
                                                    young, he realised that Chandran, filled with pride about
                                                    his looks,was taunting him.</p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 19px; color: black;">
                                                    Kutty Pullaiyaar decided to teach him a lesson. He said,”
                                                    You are filled with pride because of your beauty and
                                                    luminescence. I want this pride to leave you as it is not
                                                    making you a good person! From now on, you will be filled
                                                    with darkness!” Chandran, then realised that he had hurt
                                                    Kutty Pullaiyaar deeply and immediately felt contrite. He
                                                    also repented for what he had done- a bit of malicious
                                                    mischief which had caused pain to this little boy. He
                                                    apologised profusely and asked for forgiveness. Pullaiyaar
                                                    immediately understood that Chandran had realised his folly
                                                    and said,‘Chandra, your form will slowly diminish from full
                                                    to nothing but you will also regain it day by day until you
                                                    will glow the same.

                                                    from less to more should teach you never to take anything
                                                    for granted. It will also teach you to be without pride in

                                                    and there should be no pride or no shame in accepting that.
                                                    It will emphasise another important learning- to be careful
                                                    with your words as it can unwittingly hurt someone. Chandran
                                                    was deeply impressed by Pullaiyaar’s wisdom and bowed in
                                                    front of him for. He thanked Pullaiyaar for guiding him to
                                                    be a better person. They both then merrily stayed friends.
