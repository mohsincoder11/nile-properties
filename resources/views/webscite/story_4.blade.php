                                                    Annapurneswari in Varanasi (Kashi) is considered to
                                                    be the most benevolent form of Shakthi where she is a
                                                    nurturer.
                                                    The story of Annapurneswari is an interesting one. Here's
                                                    one version.
                                                </p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 19px; color: black;">
                                                    Once Shiva and Parvati were playing a game of dice. At some
                                                    point, the game got interesting and they started betting.
                                                    Parvati pledged her jewels and Shiva his Trishul. Shiva lost
                                                    his Trishul,
                                                    serpent, and all else and was left with only a begging bowl.
                                                    Having lost everything,
                                                    Shiva sought the help of Vishnu to win back his possessions.

                                                </p>
                                                <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 19px; color: black;">
                                                    With the help of Vishnu, he started playing a game where the
                                                    match was "fixed".
                                                    Parvati being astute realised that something was wrong when
                                                    the dice seemed to favour only Shiva.
                                                </p>

                                                    class="spectral">She accused Shiva of being a cheat. Vishnu
                                                    intervened and accepted that he was
                                                    loading the game in Shiva's favor. This led to an argument
                                                    between Shiva and Parvati. Shiva tried to use a
                                                    philosophical angle and say that everything is Maya or
                                                    illusion and all possessions
                                                    are imaginary. Shiva said even food is an illusion. The
                                                    Goddess did not agree as in her view food provided
                                                    sustenance and kept life going. She said
                                                    if food is an illusion then I am also an illusion.</p>

                                                    One thing led to the other and the Goddess said if
                                                    everything is an illusion let us see
                                                    how the world survives without me and disappears.
                                                    The disappearance of the primal force or Shakti Meant that
                                                    nature and Earth came to a stand still. There were no
                                                    seasonal variations, rains,
                                                    crops, birth and regeneration. Soon the world became arid
                                                    and there was drought.
